Hello, my name is Rishikesh Piska. 
I'm excited to present this Customer Directory App project as part of the Zithara Round 2 assessment. 
This application demonstrates my proficiency in the following technologies:
Backend Development: Node.js
Frontend Development: React.js
Database: PostgreSQL

Note: Although this isn't my original GitHub account (due to some technical difficulties), you can find more examples of my work at my main profile: https://github.com/Rishikeshpiska
